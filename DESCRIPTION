Description: An R package for neoantigen analysis that takes
    human or murine DNA missense mutations, insertions, deletions, or
    RNASeq-derived gene fusions and performs ensemble neoantigen
    prediction using 7 algorithms. Input is a VCF file, JAFFA output, or
    table of peptides or transcripts. Outputs are ranked and summarized by
    sample. Neoantigens are ranked by MHC I/II binding affinity,
    clonality, RNA expression, similarity to known immunogenic antigens,
    and dissimilarity to the normal peptidome.
