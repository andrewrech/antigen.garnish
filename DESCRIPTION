Title: Ensemble neoepitope prediction from DNA variants in R
Description: An R package for neoepitope analysis that takes human or murine DNA missense mutations, insertions, deletions, and gene fusions and performs ensemble neoepitope prediction using 7 algorithms. Input is a VCF file or table of peptides. Output is ranked neoepitopes and a summary of neoepitope load and fitness by sample. Neoepitopes are ranked by MHC I/II binding affinity, clonality, RNA expression, dissimilarity to the normal peptidome, and similarity to known immunogenic antigens.
