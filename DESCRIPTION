Title: Ensemble Antigen Prediction and Quality Analysis from DNA Variants and Proteins in R
Description: An R package for neoantigen analysis that takes human or murine DNA missense mutations, insertions, deletions, or RNASeq-derived gene fusions and performs ensemble neoantigen prediction using 7 algorithms. Input is a VCF file, JAFFA output, or table of peptides or transcripts. Outputs are ranked and summarized by sample. Neoantigens are ranked by MHC I/II binding affinity, clonality, RNA expression, similarity to known immunogenic antigens, and dissimilarity to the normal peptidome.
